- Added third person mode. To toggle between first person and third person mode, type '/spectate angle [firstperson/thirdperson]'. (Third person is a little spazzy, but it's the best I could do.)
- Added 7 new permissions: spectate.on, spectate.off, spectate.mode, spectate.angle, spectate.scan, spectate.inv, and spectate.help.
- Fixed spectating players being able to change their current item selected in the hotbar.
- Updated to 1.5.1.
