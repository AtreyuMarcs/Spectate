- Changed the way commands work.
- Fixed spectating players not being able to shoot projectiles and not being hit by projectiles.
- Added a '/spectate inv' argument that toggles inventory on and off.
- Added a spectate scan mode that switches through players at an interval. Type '/spectate scan (interval in seconds)' to enter the scan mode.
- Made players not able to interact with doors, levers, buttons, etc... again. This was accidentally removed in the previous version.
